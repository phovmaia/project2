# Rock, Paper and Scissors game

This is my second project of Udacity Nanodegree Learn to Code.
In this project I'm using python 3.9 to make a simple but funny game.

The original file is the rock_paper_scissors_original.py whre can be found the base code provided by Udacity to create the program.

My version of the game is on rock_paper_scissors.py, to run and try it, download the file, be sure you have python 3.9 installed and follow the instructions bellow:

- Open your terminal
- Go to the folder where you have the file downloaded
- Run the command "python rock_paper_scissors.py"
- Have fun
